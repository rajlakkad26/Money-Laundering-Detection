Readme file for Machine Learning Approaches for Money Laundering Detection:

Introduction:
This README file provides guidance on setting up and executing the code for the Money Laundering Detection project using Machine Learning. The project aims to develop advanced machine learning models to detect suspicious financial transactions and prevent money laundering activities effectively.

Prerequisites:
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1)Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.
2)Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to execute the code interactively. Alternatively, you can also use online pltaform such as Google Colabotory.
3)Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries by running the first cell of code file.


Setup and Execution:

1)Dataset Download: Download the financial dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1) or use the provided sample dataset file.

2)Open Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file named Money_Laundering_Detection.ipynb in your chosen environment.

3)Code Execution: Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4)Review Results: Examine the model's performance metrics and visualizations presented in the notebook. Experiment with different input parameters or test datasets to gain insights and assess model robustness.
